    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Functions helps in reusability ,helps in reducing code error ,helps to reduce the size of the execution of code gives clearity in code readability\n",
    "and modification in the program is simpler rather than typing the entire code again .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "    when its called\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "with keyword def used before writing a function definition .for eg\n",
    "def sum(a,b): #definition of sum function with def keyword\n",
    "    return a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "fucntion is equiped with a parameters and its function body whereas in function call its passed with arguments that triggers the parameters and body of the function.\n",
    "for eg:\n",
    "    def multiply(a,b):#function with its parameters\n",
    "        return a*b  #{function- \n",
    "        m=multiply(3,5)        body   }\n",
    "    print(m)  #function is called with arguments\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "In python program there is only one global scope is there and the scope remains till the termination of the code.\n",
    "Local scope ramains till the execution of the function scope\n",
    "for eg:\n",
    "a=10          # a is a global variable and it exist till execution of this code .\n",
    "def sum(a,b):\n",
    "    c=20      # c is a local variable and its scope exists within the body of sum function\n",
    "    return a+b\n",
    "print('a value:',a) #here interpreter could able to read gloabal variable a\n",
    "print('c value:',c) #here calling the value of c will fetch error as its not defined because c was a local variable\n",
    "print(sum(5,6))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "local variable get erased from the memory after the function call returns\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "return value gives the value of the data in its best format available at the time of execution.\n",
    "For eg:\n",
    "        a=9\n",
    "        return a #this will return value as 9 and the datatype of a will be int type\n",
    "Yes we can have a return value in an expression like : return a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "It will return none type\n",
    "for eg:\n",
    "def math():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(math()))\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "none type\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "it will import module name areallyourpetsnamederic\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "we can use exceptional handling with try , except and finally  concept\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "try is a keyword which does a trial on the code and after a verification if it fetches any error it sequence it to the except clause which handles the error and gives desired output.\n",
    "For eg:\n",
    " try:\n",
    "    a,b=10,0\n",
    "    c=a/b\n",
    "    print(c)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Error found'+' making b value to 1 for progranm to not crash')\n",
    "    b=1\n",
    "    c=a/b\n",
    "    print(c)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Value is handled')\n",
    "        \n",
